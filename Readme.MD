## Libraries
**[Swing](https://www.npmjs.com/package/winston):**  Graphical user interface (GUI) toolkit that is included as part of the Java Standard Library.
The use of the Swing library in this project is advantageous because Swing is an integral part of the Java Standard Library, ensuring that it is readily available without the need for additional installations or dependencies. Swing offers a cross-platform solution, enabling the game to run seamlessly on various operating systems while providing a comprehensive set of GUI components for creating an interactive and user-friendly interface. Additionally, Swing's event-driven programming model simplifies the development process by allowing for easy handling of user interactions, making it an excellent choice for building graphical applications in Java


**[Junit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/winston):**  JUnit is a widely-used testing framework in the Java ecosystem that is specifically designed for unit testing.
JUnit is employed in this Java project to facilitate robust and automated testing. As a widely-adopted testing framework, it allows for the creation of automated test cases, ensuring the reliability and correctness of code. With the ability to support Test-Driven Development, perform regression testing, and seamlessly integrate with popular Java IDEs and continuous integration pipelines, JUnit serves as an indispensable tool for maintaining code quality and preventing bugs.
